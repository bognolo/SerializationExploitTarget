# SerializationExploitTarget

POC for Java Serialisation vulnerability

SerializationExploitTarget mimicks a common library vulnerable to Java serialisation exploit. To demonstrate:
<ol>
<li>Execute Payload class to write innocuous payload to file</li>
<li>Execute Naive class to show how innocuous payload was intended to work by library authors</li>
<li>Execute Malicious class in SerializationExploit project to write malicious payload to file</li>
<li>Execute Naive class to show effect of exploit</li>
</ol>
