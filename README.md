# SerializationExploitTarget

POC for Java Serialisation vulnerability

SerializationExploitTarget mimicks a common library vulnerable to Java serialisation exploit. To demonstrate:
1- Execute Payload class to write innocuous payload to file
2- Execute Naive class to show how innocuous payload was intended to work by library authors
3- Execute Malicious class in SerializationExploit project to write malicious payload to file
4- Execute Naive class to show effect of exploit
